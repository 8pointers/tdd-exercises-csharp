# random.org random number generator

random.org offers API that you can use to generate real (and cryptographically secure) random numbers. More details about the API can be found here:

https://api.random.org/json-rpc/2/basic

Your task is to test-drive the design and the implementation of the RandomOrgRandomNumberGenerator class so that it can be used to generate a random integer between specified min and max values using the _generateIntegers_ method (see link above).

Make sure your class implements both the "happy-path" and the failure scenarios.
